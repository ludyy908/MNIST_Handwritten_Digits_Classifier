# MNIST_Handwritten_Digits_Classifier
Designing and Training a Neural Network to classify handwritten digits using the weel-known MNIST dataset.

A Jupyter Notebook was used to do all of the coding and written explanations. It was preprocessed a dataset for handwritten digit recognition, built a neural network, then trained and tuned that neural network using the downloaded data.
